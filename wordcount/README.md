# Wordcount Bot
## Programmed and tested on 3.12.2 - 28/3/24

This bot doesn't log peoples wordcount but lets people ENTER their wordcount via

`/wordcount count:x`

The wordcount will then be stored in wordcount.json along with the authors ID.

The purpose of this bot is to log peoples word count, their total word count and the servers total word count. It was made for a user who owns a discord server full of writers.

In the end, its a simple bot that can interact with a database, (remove, add, reset). You can adapt this code to make it into something else of course.

# Command List

`/wordcount count:x` - Add your wordcount (an integer) to the database

`/getwordc` - Get your current wordcount along with your TOTAL wordcount

`/leaderboard` - Outputs the TOP 10 users with the highest word count

`/setwordc user:@example count:x` - Sets a users wordcount to x

`/help` - lists all commands

# Duration to program

At my speed it was 1h and 30m or 2h

# Price

I did it for £5, but I got a £2 tip. (I am much more exspensive now)
