# All of my bots

This is a small archive of all of the discord bots I have programmed for people (I got paid). I made this archive to prove my skills as a discord developer.

All projects are open source, feel free to do what you want. My code is your code. (but dont be a skid, please credit me, thank you)

All projects I have made all have lots of documentation and a detailed explanation of what its purpose is, who I programmed it for, the time it took to program and how much I got paid.

# Why I did it in Python

I don't know any other languages that discord bots are often programmed in with lots of documentation. I didn'twant to learn JS just to make discord bots so I stuck with python and perfected my bot making and designing skills.

I have seen some discord bot libraries in C++, but they have little to no documentation and I didn't see any big advantage by making bots in C++ rather than python. (unless someone wants a reasource intensive bot)
